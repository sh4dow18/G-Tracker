## Introduction

### Purpose of the Document

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the scope of the proposed system from a high-level perspective to interested readers. It compiles the needs and characteristics of the process to be carried out in order to gather information that will enable, through analysis, the development of a technological solution for the system called "G-Tracker" that meets the expectations of its creator. The creator/developer will collaborate in addressing the technological need to establish a platform that allows tracking the video games people play throughout their lives and thus keep a record of which games have been played and which have not.

### Scope of the Document

This document officially establishes the vision and scope of the "G-Tracker" system development project. It is crucial to emphasize that this project is not related to any other project.

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- System: Technological System

## Problem Definition

The problem consists of many people keeping a record of their games on paper or in text files, which can be tedious, non-intuitive, and error-prone. This can lead to several inconveniences, including:

- **Disorganization and Data Loss**: Information about played games is stored in scattered documents, making it difficult to find specific details about a particular game.

- **Difficulty in Tracking Progress**: Keeping track of progress in games, such as the initial play date or the percentage of completion, is challenging.

- **Lack of Motivation and Sharing**: It is not an effective way to stay motivated by viewing one's game history or sharing achievements with friends.

- **Lack of Additional Information**: Players often wish to access additional information about games, such as reviews and scores, which is not available in their manual record.

- **Inability to Leverage External Sources of Information**: Players cannot leverage external sources, such as a game API, to obtain updated information about the games they are playing or planning to play.

## Who Does It Affect?

- **Individual Players**: Individual players would be the most affected. They would experience difficulties in efficiently keeping a record of their games, which could lead to data loss, lack of motivation, and an inability to make informed decisions about which games to play next.

## Impact of Not Undertaking the Project

Not developing a project for a video game tracking platform can have a significant impact, which can be outlined as follows:

- **Disorganization and Data Loss**: Players would continue to rely on inefficient methods like paper or text files to keep a record of their games. This could lead to the loss of important data.

- **Loss of Motivation**: The lack of a tool that displays progress and achievements in games could decrease players' motivation to complete games and achieve objectives within them.

- **Missed Improvement Opportunities**: By not taking advantage of a game API to obtain updated information, players could miss opportunities to enhance their gaming experience.

- **Inability to Make Informed Decisions**: Players might make blind decisions about which games to buy or play, without access to relevant information such as game reviews and ratings.

- **Waste of Time and Frustration**: Manually managing game records would consume valuable time that players could spend playing and enjoying their leisure time instead of managing disorganized records.

- **Difficulty in Tracking Personal Progress**: Without effective tracking, players could struggle to set goals and measure their progress in specific games.
